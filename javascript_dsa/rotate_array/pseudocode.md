# Pseudo-Code for Array Rotation

## Objective
The goal of this algorithm is to rotate the elements of an array to the right by a given number of positions `k`.

## Inputs
- `nums`: An array of elements to be rotated.
- `k`: The number of positions to rotate to the right.

## Output
- The input array `nums` is modified in place, with its elements rotated by `k` positions.

## Pseudo-Code
1. Calculate the length of the input array `n`.
2. Modify `k` by taking its modulo with `n` to ensure `k` is within the valid range.
3. Create a new array `result` to store the rotated elements.
4. Iterate through the elements of the input array `nums`:
   - Calculate the new index for the element as `(i + k) % n`, where `i` is the current index.
   - Place the element at the new index in the `result` array.
5. Iterate through the `result` array:
   - Copy each element from the `result` array back to the original `nums` array.
6. The `nums` array now contains the elements rotated by `k` positions.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. It needs to visit every element in the array at least once to perform the rotation.
